Hi, I'm Harikrishnan S, and I'm an enthusiastic Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer focused on building and deploying intelligent systems, not just algorithms. I confidently own the entire project lifecycle, from data collection , preparation and engineering robust features to ensuring predictive models and LLM applications , like those built with LangChain and Hugging Face, writing  scalable and production ready scripts. My go-to tools are Python, TensorFlow, and SQL, and I back it all up with serious MLOps muscle, leveraging Docker, CI/CD via GitHub Actions, and AWS to turn complex challenges in areas like healthcare , automation and more into real world business value.
